# My project is based on 2048 game where i have written a program which it will play by itself.
# It uses expectimax algorithm where maingame is used for design 2048 game board and it will initialise the grid and matrix and inserts two random numbers into the grid.
# The general idea for inserting is 2 will be inserted 90% of times and 4 will be inserted 10% of times.
# Expectimax algorithm retrievemove function which it will get best move by calling maximise function where it will get the best direction and maximum utility. once the grid  gets filled up then the game becomes over and no moves will be left.
# once the game is done what i have done is,  i will clear all the tiles and will assign maximum value in [0][1] matrix.
